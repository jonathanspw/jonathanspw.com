Hello world, I'm Jonathan Wright.

I've been a tech and open source enthusiast since the early 2000s.  I am the CTO for [KnownHost](https://www.knownhost.com).

I'm involved in several open source projects:

- [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org) where I am the Infrastructure Team Lead
- I'm a packager, EPEL SIG member, and packager sponsor for [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org)
- Through my work with AlmaLinux and Fedora I have contributed to various projects that can be seen via [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathanspw).

Outside of technology I am an avid hunter and conservationist, boating and water sports enthusiast, and member of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary having held the rank of Flotilla Commander in the past.  I have been certified as a crewman, coxswain, and PWC operator.
