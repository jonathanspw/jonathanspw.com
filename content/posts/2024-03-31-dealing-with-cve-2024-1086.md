title: "Dealing with CVE-2024-1086"

Back in January 2024 [CVE-2024-1086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1086) was published.  Most distros picked up patches for this pretty quickly but unfortunately RHEL and subsequently AlmaLinux (along with other downstreams), lagged behind.  Keeping in mind that [AlmaLinux no longer strictly follows RHEL 1:1](https://almalinux.org/blog/future-of-almalinux/), it begs the question of why this wasn't patched sooner.  The simple answer is that with regard to doing our own patching outside of what Red Hat does we are still figuring out what that looks like.  To date we mostly patch things that catch our eye as important for our users, or that users specifically ask us to patch.  Unfortunately this CVE missed the former mark, but the latter worked and the severity of this was brought to our attention on March 29.

Red Hat has [classified the severity of the issue as "Moderate"](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1086). While I am neither a security researcher nor a kernel developer, I believe the simplicity of the publicly available proof of concepts since the initial classification by Red Hat could warrant a re-evaluation. As of now, RHEL7 and CentOS 7 have received patched kernels. While RHEL8 and RHEL9 are pending updates, CentOS Stream 8 and 9, as well as RHEL 8 and 9 EUS branches (8.6, 8.8, 9.2), have been patched [according to Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1086).  I anticipate this fix dropping for RHEL 8/9 in 8.10 and 9.4 as patches are currently in the BETA releases of those versions.

Now, going back to the fact that I'm not a kernel developer or a security researcher, at first the impact of [CVE-2024-1086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1086) seems pretty targeted and perhaps minimal.  Looking a bit deeper into it and getting to what it really means is that any system with netfilter loaded and user namespaces enabled is vulnerable to rather trivial unprivileged user escalation.  What systems have netfilter loaded and user namespaces enabled?  ALL EL8 and EL9 variants do by default. 

Using some proof-of-concept code, which is freely available on GitHub, I did my own quick testing against AlmaLinux 8 and AlmaLinux 9 and immediately realized the importance and severity of this for anyone with multi-user systems, especially if those users are potentially untrusted.

```bash
[testuser@exploit-test ~]$ id
uid=1000(testuser) gid=1000(testuser) groups=1000(testuser)
[testuser@exploit-test ~]$ ./exploit

```

As you can see, running this one simple exploit immediately gave me a root shell from an otherwise-unprivileged user.

In my testing, the exploit would generally crash the system shortly after execution, sometimes after a few seconds and sometimes after a couple of minutes - I didn't look too much into how or why it crashed it because at that point it wasn't very relevant to me - a root escalation was achieved and it had to be fixed, period.

At this point all efforts moved to patching.  Luckily the [upstream patch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660) was easily backported to our kernels and on March 30 we created [AlmaLinux 8 builds](https://build.almalinux.org/build/8987) and [AlmaLinux 9 builds](https://build.almalinux.org/build/8923).  These kernels will be available in AlmaLinux production repositories by Monday, April 1.

To install these kernels in the meantime you can do so as follows:

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab tabName="AlmaLinux 8" %}}
```bash
dnf upgrade --repofrompath cve-2024-1086,https://build.almalinux.org/pulp/content/builds/AlmaLinux-8-$(arch)-8987-br
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab tabName="AlmaLinux 9" %}}
```bash
dnf upgrade --repofrompath cve-2024-1086,https://build.almalinux.org/pulp/content/builds/AlmaLinux-9-$(arch)-8923-br/
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Both of these are signed with AlmaLinux package signing, and secure boot keys and ready for production.

I also managed to build kpatch patches for AlmaLinux 8.9 (4.18.0-513*), 9.2 (5.14.0-284*), and 9.3 (5.14.0-362*) kernels.  These patches can be applied to a live running kernel without a reboot to patch the vulnerability.  I can build patches for pre-8.9 and pre-9.2 kernels if there is demand.

These patches come with all the usual warnings: **I am not a kernel developer. There is no warranty.  Use at your own risk.  I am not responsible if these patches crash or otherwise harm your system(s).**

How to install, apply, and verify application:

```bash
YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
dnf -y install kpatch
curl --silent -f -O https://jonathanspw.com/files/AlmaLinux-$(rpm --eval '%rhel')--$(uname -r|cut -d. -f1-3|sed 's/\./-/g')--CVE-2024-1086-Patch.ko || printf "${YELLOW}Unsupported kernel.  Please request it via comments and provide the following information: $(grep -E '^NAME=' /etc/os-release): $(uname -r)${NC}"
kpatch load AlmaLinux-$(rpm --eval '%rhel')--$(uname -r|cut -d. -f1-3|sed 's/\./-/g')--CVE-2024-1086-Patch.ko
```

These patches have received at least minimal testing and basic functionality checks (no immediate crashes) on the following AlmaLinux x86_64 kernels:

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" >}}
{{% tab tabName="AlmaLinux 8" %}}
* 4.18.0-513.18.1.el8_9
* 4.18.0-513.5.1.el8_9
* 4.18.0-477.27.2.el8_8
* 4.18.0-477.21.1.el8_8
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab tabName="AlmaLinux 9" %}}
* 5.14.0-362.24.1.el9_3
* 5.14.0-362.18.1.el9_3
* 5.14.0-362.13.1.el9_3
* 5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3
* 5.14.0-284.30.1.el9_2

I will update this post as these patches receive more testing on other kernel versions.  They will probably work against other EL distros such as Rocky Linux or EuroLinux, but I have not tested this.

To verify it is loaded:
```
$ kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
AlmaLinux_8_CVE_2024_1086_Patch [enabled]

Installed patch modules:
```

This will only load the patch into the currently running kernel.  I'd suggest only loading it live, not "installing" it which will auto load it after reboot.  In addition to loading it into the running kernel, install the updated kernel for AlmaLinux 8 or 9, version `kernel-4.18.0-513.18.2` or `kernel-5.14.0-362.24.2` respectively using the above test repos, or `dnf upgrade kernel` once the updated builds hit production repos.

The kpatch files above are signed with [my GPG key](/gpg-key).
